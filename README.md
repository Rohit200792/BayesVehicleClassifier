# BayesVehicleClassifier
A Naive Bayes Classifier that can be trained to classify vehicles as BUS, CAR or TRUCK. 

function M = CS6640_MM(vidObj)

    %segments moving objects in video

function object_data_list = CS6640_extract_features(videos)

    %extract features from objects identified by CS6640_MM(vidObj)

    
function model = CS6640_build_Bayes(X)

    %build Bayes model for test dataset X

    
function best_class = CS6640_Bayes(x,class_probs,class_models)

    %Bayes classifier

CS6640_Bayes_Test

    %test script that generates vehicle classes from training data and tests it against the test data
